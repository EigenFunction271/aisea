            Across the region, AI communities are built with care and effort. People organize meetups, run hackathons, mentor builders, and try to hold things together. For a while, it works.

            This is not a people problem.<br />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Independence is not enough</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Most communities operate independently. This independence matters. It allows communities to reflect local needs, culture, and energy. But independence also has limits.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            On their own, communities have little leverage with sponsors, platforms, or partners. Support is short-term. Commitments are shallow. Value flows out faster than it flows back in.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Over time, community builders put in more than they get out. Not because others intend harm, but because the system makes it easy to take and hard to give back.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA exists to make independence sustainable.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">What AISEA is trying to build</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA exists so AI communities in Southeast Asia don't have to operate alone.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            It does not replace local communities.<br />
            It does not dictate culture or programming.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Instead, AISEA does the work communities cannot easily do alone:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li>collective bargaining power</li>
            <li>continuity beyond individuals</li>
            <li>long-term relationships with partners and funders</li>
            <li>shared standards and coordination</li>
            <li>protection against extractive dynamics</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
            Communities stay local, but infrastructure is shared.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-white/20 my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">On authority and coordination</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Real coordination needs authority. Without it, alliances stay informal and fragile.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA operates with a central structure and delegated country teams. This allows negotiations, funding, and partnerships to happen once, rather than being repeated by every community.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-white/20 my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">On autonomy and choice</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA does not prohibit communities from operating independently.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Communities can and will continue to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li>seek their own sponsors</li>
            <li>form local partnerships</li>
            <li>run programs that make sense for their context</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
            AISEA is built on trade-offs. Communities choose whether to participate because:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li>shared negotiation produces better outcomes</li>
            <li>shared infrastructure reduces individual burden</li>
            <li>shared continuity protects long-term work</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
            If AISEA does not offer real value, it does not deserve participation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">On value flow</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Many ecosystems fail because value flows in one direction.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Communities are often asked to host speakers, promote platforms, or run events in exchange for exposure or vague future promises. The work is done by community operators. The long-term benefit goes elsewhere.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA exists to change this. Access to communities should lead to real returns:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li>funding that supports operators, not just one-off events</li>
            <li>partnerships that last beyond a single activation</li>
            <li>resources that reduce repeated work</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
            If value keeps flowing out without being reinvested, the system is not working.<br />
            AISEA exists to make sure communities benefit from the value they help create.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-white/20 my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">On Cross-Border Collaboration</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Cross-border collaboration in Southeast Asia is harder than it should be.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Talent is spread across the region, but access is not. Most collaboration today is limited to talks, one-off events, or personal introductions that fade quickly.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This is not a lack of interest. It is a lack of structure. AISEA exists to make cross-border work the norm.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            By sharing standards, context, and coordination, AISEA allows communities and builders to work across countries without starting from scratch each time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This includes joint programs, shared reviews, cross-border teams, and regional showcases. The goal is simple: work done in one place should travel further than it currently does.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-white/20 my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">On continuity and succession</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Communities should outlive their founders.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA exists to make this more likely by encouraging:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li>shared leadership rather than single points of failure</li>
            <li>documentation and institutional memory</li>
            <li>smoother transitions when operators step back</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
            Continuity is a requirement for any ecosystem that hopes to compound over time.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-white/20 my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">On accountability</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA exists to act on behalf of communities, not above them. Its role is to coordinate, negotiate, and maintain shared systems. It is not meant to operate without checks.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Country-level AISEA teams are trusted with real responsibility. They are expected to act in the interest of the communities they represent, not for personal gain or attention. Their job is to bring support in and make sure value flows back.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Accountability runs both ways. Communities that take part are expected to contribute and follow shared norms. In return, AISEA is expected to use its position carefully, openly, and for the benefit of the wider ecosystem.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            If something stops working, it should be addressed. Roles can be reviewed. Operators can change. Decisions can be questioned. Authority that cannot be challenged does not last.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The system matters more than any individual.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-white/20 my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">On community contribution</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA is not a passive network.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Communities that take part are expected to contribute to the shared system. What that contribution looks like may differ, but it must be real.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Some communities contribute time and effort by helping run programs, reviewing work, or supporting cross-border efforts. Others contribute by putting forward serious builders and sharing what they learn. In some cases, communities contribute resources that help sustain the system itself.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            There is no single required form. But there is a shared expectation: participation involves giving, not just receiving.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA does not measure communities by size or reach. A small community that shows up consistently is more valuable than a large one that does not.
          </p>

          <hr className="border-white/20 my-12" />

          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-white mt-12 mb-6">A long-term commitment</h2>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            AISEA is designed to ensure that:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li>communities do not collapse when individuals leave</li>
            <li>operators are supported rather than exhausted</li>
            <li>builders benefit without being exploited</li>
            <li>the ecosystem compounds instead of resetting, and</li>
            <li>the region comes together as a whole</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
            If AISEA succeeds, it will not feel revolutionary. It will feel stable.
          </p>

          <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            And stability, in a region that constantly has to start over, is already a meaningful form of progress.
