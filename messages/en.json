    "paragraph1": "AI.SEA is a builder network for people actually shipping AI in Southeast Asia.",
    "paragraph2": "It's a coalition of local communities, operators, and engineers focused on one thing: building and deploying real AI systems under real constraints.",
    "paragraph3": "We bring together builders from across SEA to co-build, test ideas in the open, and learn by doing. That includes hackathons, co-build sessions, sprints, and collaborations with serious tools and teams.",
    "paragraph4": "AI.SEA exists because we need shared infrastructure, tighter feedback loops, and a way for capable builders to find each other and move faster, together."

      "paragraph2": "What it lacks is durability.",
      "paragraph3": "Across the region, AI communities are built with care and effort. People organize meetups, run hackathons, mentor builders, and try to hold things together. For a while, it works.",
      "paragraph4": "Until it doesn't.",
      "paragraph5": "Then a lead burns out, moves on, or steps back. The community weakens. Relationships fade. Past work is lost. The next person starts again from zero.",

        "title": "Independence is not enough",
        "paragraph1": "Most communities operate independently. This independence matters. It allows communities to reflect local needs, culture, and energy. But independence also has limits.",
        "paragraph2": "On their own, communities have little leverage with sponsors, platforms, or partners. Support is short-term. Commitments are shallow. Value flows out faster than it flows back in.",
        "paragraph3": "Over time, community builders put in more than they get out. Not because others intend harm, but because the system makes it easy to take and hard to give back.",

        "paragraph1": "Real coordination needs authority. Without it, alliances stay informal and fragile.",

        "paragraph1": "Many ecosystems fail because value flows in one direction.",
        "paragraph2": "Communities are often asked to host speakers, promote platforms, or run events in exchange for exposure or vague future promises. The work is done by community operators. The long-term benefit goes elsewhere.",

        "paragraph1": "Cross-border collaboration in Southeast Asia is harder than it should be.",
        "paragraph2": "Talent is spread across the region, but access is not. Most collaboration today is limited to talks, one-off events, or personal introductions that fade quickly.",
        "paragraph3": "This is not a lack of interest. It is a lack of structure. AISEA exists to make cross-border work the norm.",
        "paragraph4": "By sharing standards, context, and coordination, AISEA allows communities and builders to work across countries without starting from scratch each time.",
        "paragraph5": "This includes joint programs, shared reviews, cross-border teams, and regional showcases. The goal is simple: work done in one place should travel further than it currently does."

        "title": "On accountability",
        "paragraph1": "AISEA exists to act on behalf of communities, not above them. Its role is to coordinate, negotiate, and maintain shared systems. It is not meant to operate without checks.",
        "paragraph2": "Country-level AISEA teams are trusted with real responsibility. They are expected to act in the interest of the communities they represent, not for personal gain or attention. Their job is to bring support in and make sure value flows back.",
        "paragraph3": "Accountability runs both ways. Communities that take part are expected to contribute and follow shared norms. In return, AISEA is expected to use its position carefully, openly, and for the benefit of the wider ecosystem.",
        "paragraph4": "If something stops working, it should be addressed. Roles can be reviewed. Operators can change. Decisions can be questioned. Authority that cannot be challenged does not last.",

      "contribution": {
        "title": "On community contribution",
        "paragraph1": "AISEA is not a passive network.",
        "paragraph2": "Communities that take part are expected to contribute to the shared system. What that contribution looks like may differ, but it must be real.",
        "paragraph3": "Some communities contribute time and effort by helping run programs, reviewing work, or supporting cross-border efforts. Others contribute by putting forward serious builders and sharing what they learn. In some cases, communities contribute resources that help sustain the system itself.",
        "paragraph4": "There is no single required form. But there is a shared expectation: participation involves giving, not just receiving.",
        "paragraph5": "AISEA does not measure communities by size or reach. A small community that shows up consistently is more valuable than a large one that does not."
